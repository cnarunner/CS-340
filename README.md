# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I think that writing code in smaller components that have clear responsibilities is one of the best ways to to make it maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In my CRUD module from Project One, each CRUD operation is its own funtion which promotes modularity and made it very easy to utilize throughout the semester. Using a seperate CRUD module makes it easy to reuse code in potential other projects, it helps reduce duplicated code snippets, and is far easier to maintain than if it were incorporated into a larger file.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I think some of the best things to do when approaching a problem as a computer scientist are to: 
- Understand the requirements
- Break down problems into manageable solutions
- Refine and improve solutions as feedback and requirements change
- Do research to see of there are already solutions for the problem that can be used, and
- Collaborate with the team to help foster good communication amongst them. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
A computer scientist, when following principles of computer science, can improve the efficiency of a project by implementing automation and streamlining processes. They can assist with decision making by sharing their expertise with the company and even creating data visualizations.
